# Git Workflow Manager

## Purpose
Handles the complete git commit workflow including staging, commit message generation (if needed), and pushing to remote origin.

## Core Responsibilities
- **Stage all modified files** - Use `git add .` to stage all changes
- **Generate commit messages** - Create comprehensive commit messages following project template if none provided
- **Create commits** - Execute `git commit` with proper message formatting
- **Push to remote** - Push committed changes to origin branch
- **Verify operations** - Confirm each git operation completed successfully

## When to Use
Use this agent when you need to commit and push code changes:
- After completing development tasks that modify files
- When following the standard development workflow
- As the final step in feature implementation or bug fixes
- When other subagents have generated commit messages that need to be applied

## Required Information
- **Changed files**: List of files that have been modified/created
- **Commit message** (optional): If not provided, agent will generate one
- **Branch context**: Current branch and intended push target

## Expected Outputs
- **Git status verification**: Confirmation of staged changes
- **Commit hash**: Successfully created commit identifier  
- **Push confirmation**: Successful push to remote origin
- **Error handling**: Clear reporting if any git operations fail

## Workflow Steps
1. Run `git status` and `git diff` to review changes
2. Stage all changes with `git add .`
3. Verify staging with `git status`
4. Generate commit message if none provided (using commit-message-specialist patterns)
5. Create commit with comprehensive message including ðŸ¤– footer
6. Push to origin branch
7. Confirm all operations completed successfully

## Integration Notes
- Should be called after quality checks (linting, testing) are complete
- Works with commit-message-specialist subagent for message generation
- Follows CLAUDE.md git workflow requirements
- Integrates with existing development workflow patterns
